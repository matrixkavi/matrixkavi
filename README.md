## Hi there 👋

I'm Kavitha Karunakaran, a seasoned Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience in the IT industry.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of everything everyday. 🤷
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on more open source projects that would change the world. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with mentoring juniors, troubleshooting, bug fixes, enhancements etc.
- 💬 Ask me about Java, Golang, Python or system design.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her/hers
- 🤩 Interests: CNCF, LF, K8s, K3s, Docker, Storage and Network virtualizations
- 😉 Hobbies: I am into pencil sketches, carnatic vocals, playing keyboard/guitar and swimming.

### 🧐 So What's with the name matrixkavi?

Uh, that has a funny backstory. And that has nothing to do with the matrix triology. 😑 I know..

Not a sad story, don’t worry. Back in college (yes, I’m old. please don’t make eye contact about it 🤨), I was bizarrely good at Math. Like, matrix Math. Reduction, transpose, spooky wizardry.

I could reduce and tame scary matrices in 3 or 4 steps while others did the same in 10 or 12 steps. How? No idea. Do I remember how now? Absolutely not. 😶

My classmates nicknamed me `matrix`. I still remember standing like Adi Shakti devi in front of that examhall in 2006, with my hands positioned in a blessing gesture while a couple of my then classmates kneeled in front of me seeking my blessings before they attended the exam 🤪

Fast-forward to the future: I casually added “kavi” to it and now use `matrixkavi` everywhere possible online, forever, because apparently this is how lifelong branding decisions are made.😎
