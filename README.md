### 🧐 So What's with the name matrixkavi?

Uh, that has a funny backstory. And that has nothing to do with the matrix trilogy. 😑 I know..

Not a sad story, don’t worry. Back in college, I was bizarrely good at Math. Like, matrix Math. Reduction, transpose, spooky wizardry.

I could reduce and tame scary matrices in 3 or 4 steps while others did the same in 10 or 12 steps. How? No idea. Do I remember how now? Absolutely not. 😶

My classmates nicknamed me `matrix`. I still remember standing like Adi Shakti devi in front of that examhall in 2006, with my hands positioned in a blessing gesture while a couple of my then classmates kneeled in front of me seeking my blessings before they attended the exam 🤪

Fast-forward to the future: I casually added “kavi” to it and now use `matrixkavi` everywhere possible online, forever, because apparently this is how lifelong branding decisions are made.😎
